# YouTube Strategy

You have the following YouTube content production skills available. Present them to the user in a clean table and ask what they'd like to work on:

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| YouTube Research | `/yt-research` | Research competitor channels, niches, and trending topics using web research |
| YouTube Ideation | `/yt-ideate` | Generate and validate video ideas aligned with content pillars and audience strategy |
| YouTube Brief | `/yt-brief` | Refine a video idea into a structured brief with angle, key points, and value proposition |
| YouTube Packaging | `/yt-package` | Create optimized titles and thumbnail concepts for maximum CTR |
| YouTube Outline | `/yt-outline` | Build step-by-step video outlines with demo prep, screen-share sequences, and visual planning |
| Full Pipeline | `/yt-pipeline` | Run the complete Research > Ideate > Brief > Package > Outline workflow with human checkpoints |

These skills follow a complete content production workflow. The goal is to handle research, ideation, briefing, packaging, and outlining so the creator can focus on filming.

Ask the user which skill they want to use, then invoke that skill's slash command.
