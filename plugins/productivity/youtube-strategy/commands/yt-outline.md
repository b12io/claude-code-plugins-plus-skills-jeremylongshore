Run the YouTube Outline skill. This is the final stage of the content production workflow - building a detailed step-by-step outline with demo sequences, screen-share planning, and visual needs.

Read the skill definition at `skills/yt-outline/SKILL.md` and follow its workflow exactly.

The outline is the final pre-production artifact before the team preps demos and filming begins.
