Run the YouTube Packaging skill. This is the packaging stage of the content production workflow - creating optimized title options and thumbnail concepts once a brief is locked.

Read the skill definition at `skills/yt-packaging/SKILL.md` and follow its workflow exactly.

Packaging is where the video's click-through rate is determined. Title and thumbnail must work together as a system.
