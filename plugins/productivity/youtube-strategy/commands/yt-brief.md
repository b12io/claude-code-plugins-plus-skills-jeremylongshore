Run the YouTube Brief skill. This is the briefing stage of the content production workflow - refining a selected video idea into a structured brief that defines the angle, key points, value proposition, CTA asset, and audience segment.

Read the skill definition at `skills/yt-brief/SKILL.md` and follow its workflow exactly.

This is a collaborative step. The brief must be reviewed and approved before moving to packaging.
